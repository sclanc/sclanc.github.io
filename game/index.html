                using game pieces called stones. The game ends when neither player wishes to continue. A more detailed explaination of the game, it's rules, and strategies can

                 The game grid will be represented by a 2 dimentional JavaScript array. 
                 The 2 dimentional array will be filled with numbers; 0 for unoccupied, 1 for player 1, 2 for player 2. 
                 Java Script functions will modify this data according to the rules of the game. 
                 Each player's score will be stored as seperate variables 
                 a boolean will keep track of whose turn it is 
                 A boolean will keep track of whether or not the game is over

                Note: a sample of a game in progress may be found by pressing the play button, the sample game seen also in gameGrid.html is built on the board that will 
                be used for actual gameplay in future assignments. I did my best to make that board responsive to different screen sizes, but more work may need to be done.
                Because the game of Go is played by placing stones on the intersection of lines on the game board, there are two HTML tables used for this board, one has a 
                black 1px border to outline the 13x13 playing grid, the seccond is layered on top of the original in such a way that stones may be placed at the intersection
                of gridlines in the original grid.
