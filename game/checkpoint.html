                            checkBoard() recursivly checks each intersection of the board, to make sure that any pieces that are in place are not entrapped.

        More than 25% of the game logic has been completed in that you can visably interact with all of the peices that are placed on the board, turns alternate automatically
        and the game state is being dynamically modified according to user input. I have been trying to implement the game logic as I completed the labs.
