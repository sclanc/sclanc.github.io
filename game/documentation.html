                Game grid that uses CSS and is generated by JavaScript: The game.html page is nothing but a thin structure of tags before 
                the majority of the page is created by DOM manipulation, the game board itself is created by inserting a table structure into
                DOM. The CSS for this page is also generated by the game.js file, the functions that do these tasks can be seen under the 
                "Game generation and DOM Manip" section of the code, as designated by a comment block.
            </p>
            <p>
                User input in the form of text, select options, and/or buttons: The user uses buttons to choose their game board size, 
                they use text input to write their names, and they use an option menu to reset the board, or change it's size. 
            </p>
            <p>
                User input in the form of mouse clicks: game play is the direct result of users clicking on the intersection of gridlines
            </p>
            <p>
                Dynamic modification of HTML using innerHTML or DOM functions: when a user clicks on a valid intersection, a player peice will
                be injected into the DOM. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Use of XMLHttpRequest to load JSON or XML game data that is displayed on the grid page: See the importSavedGame() function under 
                the Tangental Features comment block. this is the same function that was used in a previous lab to import a saved game state. You 
                may need to use the correct browser to get results.
            </p>
            <p>
                Incorporates HTML 5 audio tags, video tags, canvas, or local storage: this application uses local storage to store user data
                AND uses canvas elements to create the gridlines that a user will see when playing the game.

                 Game Logic Code: I am most proud of the complexly elegent solution that I made to track all of the rules of Go. The game logic 
                 can be found under the critical game logic, and recursion functions coment blocks. I would love to know what you think about it.
                 The game survived all of my unit tests with no bugs in the logic, it is fast, responsive, and completly encapsulates the complex 
                 rules of Go.
